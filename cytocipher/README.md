# Cytocipher code organisation

Please note that, Cytocipher functionality is being actively extended beyond 
enrichment scoring and testing for significantly different clusters.

The module containing the code for the Cytocipher score and merge
functionality is:

    score_and_merge/

Other modules will be communicated when adequately developed and tested.
